# Python Ethical Hacking Practice

Welcome to my `python_etical_hacking` project! 🚀  
This is my personal journey of learning Python for ethical hacking and cybersecurity.

## 📁 Project Overview

This project will include small scripts and examples related to:

- System and OS tasks using Python's `os` module
- Basic automation and scripting tasks
- Ethical hacking tools and utilities (as I learn more)

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python 3.x**
- Built-in modules:
  - `os`
- I plan to explore:
  - `socket`
  - `subprocess`
  - `requests`
  - `nmap` (using python-nmap)
  - More as I grow 💻

## 🌱 Why This Project?

I’m new to Python and currently learning it along with networking and cybersecurity.  
This repo is my personal practice zone to:

- Improve coding skills in Python
- Build automation scripts
- Create tools for ethical hacking
- Document what I learn along the way

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This project is under active learning mode. I’ll keep pushing updates as I learn:

- [x] Python basics
- [ ] Network scanning
- [ ] Automation tools
- [ ] Simple GUI with Tkinter or CLI tools

## 🤝 Contributions

Right now, this is just my personal journey, but I’m open to feedback and tips from the community.

## 📌 Note

This project is **strictly for educational purposes only.**  
I do **not** support any illegal hacking or misuse of these tools.
